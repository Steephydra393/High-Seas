# High-Seas
Collect coins in the high seas ahead!

## Software behind High-Seas
- Primarily Python, HTML, CSS, and loads of javascript!

The website gets offered to your browser via Python Flask

Your browser gets to do the heavy lifting - in terms of functionality!

Using a blend of Flask and Javascript, I can create reactive apps quickly, focusing on quality

## Inspiration
- Name: HighSeas by HackClub

- Game/Functionality: Pirates searching the ocean for ~~coins~~ **doubloons**!

- Asthetics: TBD
